# WK11 

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript exercises completed as part of classwork. The focus is on understanding core JavaScript concepts such as array methods, problem-solving, and modern ES6+ syntax.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Array Methods

* `map()` – transforming data
* `filter()` – selecting specific data
* `reduce()` – combining data into a single value
* `sort()` – ordering data
* `every()` – checking conditions across all elements

---

### 2. ES6+ Features

* Arrow functions
* Destructuring
* Template literals
* Spread operator (`...`)
* `let` and `const`

---

### 3. Problem Solving

#### ✅ Student Data Processing

* Calculating total scores and averages using `reduce()`
* Filtering students who submitted assignments
* Sorting students into leaderboard order
* Counting submitted assignments

#### ✅ Refactoring Legacy Code

* Replacing `for` loops with modern array methods
* Improving readability using ES6+ syntax

#### ✅ Stack-Based Problem

* Valid parentheses checker using a stack
* Understanding LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)
* Handling edge cases in bracket matching

---

### 4. Asynchronous JavaScript

* Introduction to **Promises**
* Handling success (`resolve`) and failure (`reject`)
* Using `.then()` and `.catch()`
* Using `async/await`

---

##  Example Exercises

### 🔹 Exercise 1: ES6 Refactor

Refactored legacy code to:

* Use `filter()` instead of loops
* Apply destructuring
* Use template literals for output

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2: Valid Parentheses

* Implemented a stack-based algorithm
* Ensured correct bracket matching and order

---

##  Key Learnings

* Writing cleaner and more readable code using modern JavaScript
* Understanding how to replace loops with array methods
* Breaking down problems into smaller logical steps
* Using stacks for real-world algorithm problems
* Handling asynchronous operations with Promises

---

## How to Run

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

```bash
node filename.js
```

Example:

```bash
node ex1-refactor.js
```
